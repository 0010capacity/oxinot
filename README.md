# MD Outliner

A modern markdown outliner application built with Tauri, React, and TypeScript. This app combines the power of block-based outliner editing (like Logseq) with a unique file tree navigation system.

## 🌟 Features

### Modern Desktop UI
- **Custom titlebar** - Native-looking titlebar with integrated breadcrumb navigation
- **OS-aware window controls** - macOS traffic lights or Windows/Linux controls
- **Minimal design** - All controls in the titlebar for maximum content space
- **Draggable titlebar** - Move the window naturally from the title area

### Unique File Tree Integration
- **No separate file explorer sidebar** - Navigate your workspace directly in the main outliner view
- **Folder notes** - Every folder automatically gets its own markdown note
- **Unified interface** - Switch seamlessly between file tree view and document editing with the same outliner layout

### Powerful Outliner Editor
- **Block-based editing** - Logseq-style outliner with infinite nesting
- **Live markdown rendering** - See formatted text as you type
- **Full markdown support** - Headings, code blocks, lists, links, and more
- **Keyboard-first workflow** - Tab/Shift+Tab for indenting, Enter for new blocks

### Local-First & Fast
- **Built with Tauri** - Lightweight desktop app powered by Rust
- **Direct file system access** - Work with real `.md` files on your computer
- **Auto-save** - Changes are automatically saved to disk
- **SQLite + Filesystem** - Database for quick navigation, markdown files as source of truth

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- Rust (for Tauri)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd md-editor
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run in development mode:
```bash
npm run tauri:dev
```

4. Build for production:
```bash
npm run tauri:build
```

## 📖 How It Works

### Workspace Selection
When you first launch the app, you'll be prompted to select a workspace folder. This folder will contain all your markdown documents.

If the folder is empty, a `Welcome.md` file is automatically created to help you get started.

### File Tree View
The main view shows your workspace as an outliner structure:
- **Folders** appear as collapsible nodes with folder icons
- **Markdown files** appear as bullet points (without `.md` extension)
- Click any file to open it in the editor
- Click folders to expand/collapse their contents

### Document Editing
When you open a file:
- Switch to editor mode with the "📄 Editor" button
- Edit using the block-based outliner interface
- Changes are auto-saved after 1 second of inactivity
- Return to file tree view with the "📁 Tree" button

### Folder Notes
Every folder automatically has a folder note (e.g., `MyFolder/MyFolder.md`). This lets you:
- Add descriptions and metadata to folders
- Organize your thoughts about a collection of documents
- Use folders as first-class outline nodes

## 🎨 UI Design

The interface is inspired by modern note-taking apps with a clean, minimal design:
- **Custom titlebar** - Native window controls integrated with breadcrumb navigation
- **Dark mode by default** (light mode available via titlebar toggle)
- **Tabler icons** for a consistent, modern look
- **Inter font** for excellent readability
- **Hover interactions** - Controls appear when you need them
- **No clutter** - All controls in titlebar, maximum space for content

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Frontend

### Backend
- **Tauri 2** - Desktop app framework with custom titlebar
- **Rust** - File system operations
- **SQLite** - Fast metadata storage and search
- **Native dialogs** - Folder selection

### Markdown Processing
- **@lezer/markdown** - Parsing
- **markdown-it** - Rendering
- Custom block-based data structure
