# Regex (Rust/grep ERE) for files that may be ignored by CI.
# One line, no surrounding slashes.
#
# Intended usage:
# - In workflows, read this file and use it with `grep -E` / `grep -Ev`
# - If all changed files match this regex, CI can short-circuit successfully.
#
# Keep in sync with repository policy for "docs/config-only changes".
